But their plan was not to be. Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities, the 600 or so men now await deportation, prevented from leaving their makeshift jail by armed soldiers. Conditions at the warehouse are growing increasingly desperate. Several days ago, the authorities stopped handing out food and basic supplies. "" I came from Djibouti to work.

Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to restore Yemen ' s exiled government to power and roll back the Iran - aligned Houthi movement.
